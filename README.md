This project provides an API interface for interacting with WhatsApp using the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).

## Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **HTTP Framework**: [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/)
- **Database**: [Redis](https://redis.io/) (for session storage and API key management)
- **WhatsApp Integration**: [@whiskeysockets/baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)

> [!NOTE]
> This project is not meant to be a full-fledged WhatsApp server. It is a wrapper around the Baileys library, providing an HTTP interface for easier integration with other applications.
>
> Thus, we do not store WhatsApp messages or any other data (aside from credentials for auto-reconnecting).
>
> If you need a chat application with a database, consider using our fork of [Chatwoot](https://github.com/fazer-ai/chatwoot/), which integrates with this API.

## Functionality

The API exposes the following endpoints. Keep in mind this project is in early development, and many features are still being implemented.

> [!NOTE]
> See also our [Swagger documentation](https://fazer-ai.github.io/baileys-api/) for a more detailed overview of the API.

### Status

- `GET /status`: Checks if the server is running. Returns "OK" if the server is healthy.
- `GET /status/auth`: Checks if the provided API key is valid. Returns "OK" if authenticated.

### Connections

- `POST /connections/:phoneNumber`: Initiates a new WhatsApp connection for the given phone number.
- `PATCH /connections/:phoneNumber/presence`: Updates the presence status for a connection.
- `POST /connections/:phoneNumber/send-message`: Sends a message through an active connection.
- `POST /connections/:phoneNumber/read-messages`: Marks messages as read.
- `DELETE /connections/:phoneNumber`: Logs out and disconnects a WhatsApp connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `phoneNumber` parameter in the URL should be in the format `+<country_code><phone_number>`, e.g. `+551234567890`.

### Admin

- `POST /admin/connections/logout-all`: Logs out all active WhatsApp connections. (Requires admin role API key)

## Deployment

This project includes a [`docker-compose.coolify.yml`](./docker-compose.coolify.yml) file ready for deployment on [Coolify](https://coolify.io/).

### Coolify Deployment

The provided Docker Compose file is configured to work within a Coolify environment that has an existing Redis instance on the same network. The API will connect to this Redis instance using the `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variables that you should provide in the environment variables section of the Coolify dashboard.

The compose file also automates the creation of a default API key. This key is generated using `SERVICE_PASSWORD_64_DEFAULTAPIKEY` (an auto-generated Coolify service password) and can be retrieved from the service's environment variables in the Coolify dashboard.

### Other Docker Environments

The `docker-compose.coolify.yml` can be adapted for other Docker environments. You may need to:

1.  **Provide a Redis Instance**:
    - If you have an existing Redis instance, update the `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to your Redis service.
    - Alternatively, you can add a new Redis service definition to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2.  **API Key Management**:
    - In production/non-development environments, authentication is required. The `manage-api-keys.ts` script is used to create and manage API keys.
    - The provided `docker-compose.coolify.yml` automatically creates a user API key using the command: `bun manage-api-keys create user ${SERVICE_PASSWORD_64_DEFAULTAPIKEY}`. You can adapt this or run the script manually within the container or a separate environment to generate your API keys.
    - To create an API key manually:
      ```bash
      bun scripts/manage-api-keys.ts create <role> [key]
      ```
      (e.g., `bun scripts/manage-api-keys.ts create user mysecretapikey`)
    - Store these keys securely and provide them in the `x-api-key` header for authenticated requests.
    - In development (`NODE_ENV=development`), authentication is bypassed.

## Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Copy the example environment file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, edit the `.env` file with your desired configurations.

| `BAILEYS_PRINT_QR`                    | If `true`, prints the WhatsApp connection QR code to the terminal.                                         | `false`                  |
| `REDIS_URL`                           | The connection URL for your Redis instance.                                                                | `redis://localhost:6379` |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD`                      | The password for your Redis instance (if any).                                                             |                          |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_POLICY_MAX_RETRIES`    | Maximum number of retries for sending webhook events.                                                      | `3`                      |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_POLICY_RETRY_INTERVAL` | Initial interval in milliseconds between webhook retry attempts.                                           | `5000`                   |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_POLICY_BACKOFF_FACTOR` | Factor by which the retry interval increases after each attempt (exponential backoff).                     | `3`                      |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`                         | The allowed origin for CORS requests. Should be set if you plan to run the API on a dedicated server.      | `localhost:3025`         |

4.  **(Optional) Create API Keys for Development (if not bypassing auth)**:
    If you wish to test authentication in development, you can create API keys:

    ```bash
    bun scripts/manage-api-keys.ts create user yourdesiredapikey
    ```

    Remember to set `NODE_ENV` to something other than `development` in your `.env` if you want to enforce API key usage locally.

5.  **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

    The server will watch for file changes and automatically restart.

6.  **API Documentation**:
    Open [http://localhost:3025/swagger](http://localhost:3025/swagger) in your browser to view the Swagger API documentation and test the endpoints.
